# RM-SORN
This code contains the necessary files to simulate the RM-SORN model proposed in paper *A Reward-Modulated Self-Organizing Recurrent
Network based on Neural Plasticity Mechanisms*, which is under review in *International Joint Conference of Neural Network (IJCNN)*.
Our RM-SORN model is based on previous SORN and, the network implementation (souce code) is based on the SORN implementation by [Hartmann et al.](https://github.com/chrhartm/SORN).
